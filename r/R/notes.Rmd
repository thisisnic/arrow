OK, so the first code "path" I need to be thinking about is:

1. `arrow_dplyr_query` object
2. `collect()`
3. `do_exec_plan()`

This takes the thing we're building our query in and gets it into the right 
state to actually put together the query plan.

I think I need more knowledge of ExecPlans and ExecNodes at a conceptual level now.

First things; what methods do they have?

ExecPlan:

* Scan
* Build
* Run
* Stop

ExecNode:

* sort
* head
* tail
* preserve_sort
* Project
* Filter
* Aggregate
* Join
